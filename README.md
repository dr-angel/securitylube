In this repo, I hope you'll find a number of handy Powershell tools/scripts related to enhancing Windows security, exploring PoSH and for fun and profit. 

There'll be scripts to run once off, or ones to run on a schedule. Depends on the script, really.

Scripts will be written as documentation - peel and see.
