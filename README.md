In this repo, I hope you'll find a number of handy Powershell tools/scripts related to enhancing Windows security, exploring PoSH and for fun and profit. 

You can run these scripts once off, in Task Scheduler or from Remote Monitoring and Management platforms. Depends on the script, really.

Scripts will be written as documentation - read them for details.
